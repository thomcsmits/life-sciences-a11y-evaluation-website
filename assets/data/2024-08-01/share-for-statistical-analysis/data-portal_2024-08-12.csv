The lack of innovations in antibiotic development has led to renewed interest in antibiotic adjuvants. However, there is no database to collect antibiotic adjuvants. Herein, we build a comprehensive database named Antibiotic Adjuvant DataBase (AADB) by manually collecting relevant literature. Specifically, AADB includes 3,035 combinations of antibiotics with adjuvants, covering 83 antibiotics, 226 adjuvants, and 325 bacterial strains. AADB provides user-friendly interfaces for searching and downloading. Users can easily obtain these datasets for further analysis. In addition, we also collected related datasets (e.g., chemogenomic and metabolomic data) and proposed a computational strategy to dissect these datasets. As a test case, we identified 10 candidates for minocycline, and 6 of 10 candidates are the known adjuvants that synergize with minocycline to inhibit the growth of E. coli BW25113. We hope that AADB can help users to identify effective antibiotic adjuvants.

The recent availability of methods to map protein-RNA interactions in entire transcriptomes such as RIP, CLIP and their variants, together with global polysomal and ribosome profiling techniques, are driving the exponential accumulation of vast amounts of data on mRNA contacts in cells, and of corresponding predictions of PTR events. However, this exceptional quantity of information cannot be exploited at its best to reconstruct potential PTR networks, as it still lies scattered throughout several databases and in isolated reports of single interactions. To address this issue, we developed the second and vastly enhanced version of the Atlas of UTR Regulatory Activity (AURA 2), a meta-database centered on mapping interaction of trans-factors with human and mouse UTRs. AURA 2 includes experimentally demonstrated binding sites for RBPs, ncRNAs, thousands of cis-elements, variations, RNA epigenetics data and more. Its user-friendly interface offers various data-mining features including co-regulation search, network generation and regulatory enrichment testing. Gene expression profiles for many tissues and cell lines can be also combined with these analyses to display only the interactions possible in the system under study. AURA 2 aims at becoming a valuable toolbox for PTR studies and at tracing the road for how PTR network-building tools should be designed.

Among the agents of infection and disease in domestic poultry and wild birds, Mycoplasma gallisepticum is the most important mycoplasma species, causing considerable losses in the poultry industry. In the present paper, we provide data on adaptation of M. gallisepticum to the eukaryotic host cells on the genomic level. The major changes were predominantly localized in the VlhA-hemagglutinin genes which are important components of pathogenesis. The ability of mycoplasmas to change dramatically the repertoire of surface antigens and to vary the immunogenicity of these components allows them to remain undetected by the immune system of the host. The data presented in this article are related to the article entitled ""Phase Transition of the Bacterium upon Invasion of a Host Cell as a Mechanism of Adaptation: a Mycoplasma gallisepticum Model.""

One such group of chemicals, namely, Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs), have the ability to perturb the normal functioning of the biological system. In order to screen such chemicals in our daily life, we have developed a detailed workflow which was employed to process more than 16000 scientific abstracts to identify EDCs with supporting evidence for endocrine disruption upon exposure based on the observed endocrine-mediated endpoints specific to humans or rodents.

However, despite the fact that the biological activity of many proteins often arises from specific domain-domain and domain-ligand interactions, current on-line resources rarely provide a direct mapping from structure to function at the domain level. Since the PDB now contains many tens of thousands of protein chains, and since protein sequence databases can dwarf such numbers by orders of magnitude, there is a pressing need to develop automatic structure-function annotation tools which can operate at the domain level. This article presents ECDomainMiner, a novel content-based filtering approach to automatically infer associations between EC numbers and Pfam domains. ECDomainMiner finds a total of 20,728 non-redundant EC-Pfam associations with a F- measure of 0.95 with respect to a ""Gold Standard"" test set extracted from InterPro. Compared to the 1,515 manually curated EC-Pfam associations in InterPro, ECDomainMiner infers a 13-fold increase in the number of EC-Pfam associations.

Since their first description about two decades ago, numerous studies have been undertaken dealing with the design, synthesis, characterization and application of foldamers. They have huge application potential as antimicrobial, anticancer and anti-HIV agents and in materials science. Despite their importance, there is no publicly available web resource providing comprehensive information on these compounds. Here we describe FoldamerDB, an open-source, fully annotated and manually curated database of peptidic foldamers. FoldamerDB holds the information about the sequence, structure and biological activities of the foldamer entries. It contains the information on over 1319 species and 1018 activities, collected from more than 160 research papers. The web-interface is designed to be clutter-free, user-friendly and it is compatible with devices of different screen sizes. The interface allows the user to search the database, browse and filter the foldamers using multiple criteria. It also offers a detailed help page to assist new users. FoldamerDB is hoped to bridge the gap in the freely available web-based resources on foldamers and will be of interest to diverse groups of scientists from chemists to biologists.

Enzybiotics are becoming increasingly recognized as potential alternative therapies for drug-resistant bacteria. Enzybiotics are referred to as bacterial cell wall-degrading enzymes, including lysins, bacteriocins, autolysins, and lysozymes. Fischetti and coworkers coined the term ""enzybiotics"" for these proteins, describing both enzymatic and antibacterial properties. The most important characteristics of enzybiotics are their novel mechanisms of antibacterial action and capacity to kill antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Another significant feature of certain enzybiotics is their low probability of developing bacterial resistance.

Enzybiotics have been optimized through evolution to cause fast and efficient lysis of the host cell from within, thereby ensuring the phage's survival. However, this does not preclude that there is still potential for important when it comes to application from without, especially in complex environments such as certain food matrics, blood or on mucous membranes.

We find that potential causal variants are enriched in coding and flanking regions, as well as in regulatory elements, and show variation in polygenicity and discoverability of traits.

There are 3 major interaction types in an interactome: microbiome-DME interaction (MICBIO), xenobiotics-DME interaction (XEOTIC), and host protein-DME interaction (HOSPPI). The interaction data of each type are essential for drug metabolism, and the collective consideration of multiple types has implication for the future practice of precision medicine. However, no database was designed to systematically provide the data of all types of DME interactions. Here, a database of the Interactome of Drug-Metabolizing Enzymes (INTEDE) was therefore constructed to offer these interaction data. First, 1,047 unique DMEs (448 host and 599 microbial) were confirmed, for the first time, using their metabolizing drugs. Second, for these newly confirmed DMEs, all types of their interactions (3,359 MICBIOs between 225 microbial species and 185 DMEs; 47,778 XEOTICs between 4,150 xenobiotics and 501 DMEs; 7,849 HOSPPIs between 565 human proteins and 566 DMEs) were comprehensively collected and then provided, which enabled the crosstalk analysis among multiple types.

We make use of the modular structure of repeat motifs to amplify signals of selection from population genetics and traditional inter-species conservation. For each repeat protein repeat domain, we construct a motif-MSA and then accumulate single nucleotide variants (SNVs) across the human population based on the genomic coordinate system of the motif-MSA.

It also provides a readily available source of data for fast validation of experimental results and for exploratory analyses. Finally, it is a shared resource that can be used to foster large-scale collaborations in sleep study.
MASS is composed of cohorts themselves comprising subsets. Recordings within subsets is kept as homogeneous as possible, whereas it is more heterogeneous between subsets. To allow inter-study comparisons, researchers validating their results on MASS are encouraged to specify which portion of the database they used in their assessment (e.g., MASS-C1 for the whole cohort 1, MASS-C1/SS1-SS3 for subsets 1, 2 and 3 of cohort 1).",2014.0,Center for Advanced Research in Sleep Medicine,"Center for Advanced Research in Sleep Medicine, Montreal Sacred Heart Hospital, Montreal, QC, Canada",,,,Christian O'Reilly,m-charron@crhsc.rtss.qc.ca,1.0,,9.0,42.0,$2a$10$8PbO5sorE7nvXcoJabMroO5I8DDbcjo9gUUNlBD5SbizXPbiaSMjq,1544146462812.0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,,1517152832000.0,2023-03-03 10:14:20,Other,Literature,sleep,Animal,Homo sapiens,,4.66667,2014.0,,2022-12-04 00:01:44,1.0,Canada,http://www.ceams-carsm.ca/en/MASS,North America,45,682,727,0.061898211829436035

In the present study, we evaluated the database consistency and various analysis parameters both by testing the reference collection against itself and by using an external population-based data set comprising 629 different strains. Under the optimal conditions found, lineage predictions based on typing by 24-locus MIRU-VNTR analysis optionally combined with spoligotyping were verified in >99% of the cases.

This concept can also be extended to three or more genes for SL. Computational and experimental methods have been developed to predict and verify SL gene pairs, especially for yeast and Escherichia coli. However, there is currently a lack of a specialized platform to collect microbial SL gene pairs. Therefore, we designed a synthetic interaction database for microbial genetics that collects 13,313 SL and 2,994 Synthetic Rescue (SR) gene pairs that are reported in the literature, as well as 86,981 putative SL pairs got through homologous transfer method in 281 bacterial genomes. Our database website provides multiple functions such as search, browse, visualization, and Blast. Based on the SL interaction data in the S. cerevisiae, we review the issue of duplications' essentiality and observed that the duplicated genes and singletons have a similar ratio of being essential when we consider both individual and SL.

To systematically prioritize the oncogenic ability of somatic mutations and cancer genes, we constructed a useful platform, OncoVar (https://oncovar.org/), which employed published bioinformatics algorithms and incorporated known driver events to identify driver mutations and driver genes. We identified 20 162 cancer driver mutations, 814 driver genes and 2360 pathogenic pathways with high-confidence by reanalyzing 10 769 exomes from 33 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and 1942 genomes from 18 cancer types in International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC). OncoVar provides four points of view, ‘Mutation’, ‘Gene’, ‘Pathway’ and ‘Cancer’, to help researchers to visualize the relationships between cancers and driver variants. Importantly, identification of actionable driver alterations provides promising druggable targets and repurposing opportunities of combinational therapies. OncoVar provides a user-friendly interface for browsing, searching and downloading somatic driver mutations, driver genes and pathogenic pathways in various cancer types. This platform will facilitate the identification of cancer drivers across individual cancer cohorts and helps to rank mutations or genes for better decision-making among clinical oncologists, cancer researchers and the broad scientific community interested in cancer precision medicine.",2021.0,Peking University Third Hospital,,Beijing,Beijing,V1,Fengbiao Mao,maofengbiao@126.com,1.0,2020,2.0,28.0,,,0.0,maofengbiao@126.com,0.0,,maofengbiao@126.com,0.0,,1612492784000.0,2023-03-03 10:17:27,DNA,"Genotype phenotype and variation, Health and medicine","driver genes, oncogenic pathways, driver mutation",Animal,human,,14.0,0.0,,2022-12-04 00:02:48,0.0,China,https://oncovar.org/,Asia,54,435,489,0.11042944785276074

Deploying a workflow to quantify 8,498 proteins, these data capture evidence of cell-type and post-transcriptional modifications. Integrating multi-omics, drug response, and CRISPR-Cas9 gene essentiality screens with a deep learning-based pipeline reveals thousands of protein biomarkers of cancer vulnerabilities that are not significant at the transcript level. The power of the proteome to predict drug response is very similar to that of the transcriptome. Further, random downsampling to only 1,500 proteins has limited impact on predictive power, consistent with protein networks being highly connected and co-regulated.

Moreover, increasing use of superficial comparison with previously characterized CLiPs introduces or propagates erroneous attributions, clouding further scientific progress. We provide a generally applicable characterization methodology based on matching NMR spectral fingerprints of newly isolated CLiPs to natural and synthetic reference compounds with (un)known stereochemistry. In addition, NMR fingerprinting is shown to provide a suitable basis for structural dereplication.

While powerful, these methods suffer from a high false-positive rate between the predicted triplexes and the biological experiments.

Each genome comes with a companion MOD file, which can be used to remap coordinates from the FASTA sequences back to reference coordinates. This is necessary since, in general, all gene and genomic annotations are specified relative to the reference. MOD files are genome and version specific, and therefore should always be downloaded together as a set with their associated FASTA sequence.

However, these tools are separately available in different online websites or databases, making it challenging for general clinicians, geneticists and biologists to obtain the first-hand information regarding some particular variants and genes of interest. Starting with coding regions and splice sties, we artificially generated all possible single nucleotide variants (n = 110 154 363) and cataloged all reported insertion and deletions (n = 1 223 370). We then annotated these variants with respect to functional consequences from more than 60 genomic data sources to develop a database, named VarCards (http://varcards.biols.ac.cn/), by which users can conveniently search, browse and annotate the variant- and gene-level implications of given variants, including the following information: (i) functional effects; (ii) functional consequences through different in silico algorithms; (iii) allele frequencies in different populations; (iv) disease- and phenotype-related knowledge; (v) general meaningful gene-level information; and (vi) drug-gene interactions.

Two criteria have to be met for entering WallProtDB. First one is related to the identification of proteins. Only proteins identified in plant with available genomic or ESTs data are considered to ensure unambiguous identification. Second criterion is related to the difficulty to obtain clean cell wall fractions. Indeed, since cell walls constitute an open compartment difficult to isolate, numerous proteins predicted to be intracellular and/or having functions inside the cell have been identified in cell wall extracts. Then, except proteins predicted to be plasma membrane proteins, only proteins having a predicted signal peptide and no known intracellular retention signal are included in the database. In addition, WallProtDB contains information about the strategies used to obtain cell wall protein extracts and to identify proteins by mass spectrometry and bioinformatics. Mass spectrometry data are included when available. All the proteins of WallProtDB are linked to ProtAnnDB, another database, which contains structural and functional bioinformatics annotations of proteins as well as links to other databases (Aramemnon, CAZy, Planet, Phytozome, UniProt).

This is true for studies of brain disorders, such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease and autism, where often alternative, easily obtainable peripheral tissues such as blood or buccal samples are used instead. In order to establish the relevance of associated loci, these are subsequently followed up in available cohorts of brain tissue. Here we introduce an online tool which allows the user to perform this secondary analysis by investigating the correlation of DNA methylation in blood with four brain regions (prefrontal cortex, entorhinal cortex, superior temporal gyrus and cerebellum) from 71-75 matched samples for all probes present on the Illumina 450K Beadchip array.",2015.0,University of Exeter,"University of Exeter Medical School, University of Exeter, Exeter, UK",,,,Eilis Hannon,E.J.Hannon@exeter.ac.uk,1.0,,8.0,202.0,$2a$10$77NoNW4SfHUoRs58Wnr.NuvOEUwbFxddzUaVZqDV.n6lxL7S5JiUK,1544146752942.0,0.0,,0.0,,,0.0,,1517157574000.0,2023-03-03 10:14:28,DNA,Gene genome and annotation,gene co-expression and correlation,Animal,Homo sapiens,,25.25,2015.0,,2022-12-04 00:01:47,1.0,United Kingdom,http://epigenetics.essex.ac.uk/bloodbrain,Europe,21,106,127,0.16535433070866143

However, experiments are often performed on data selected by the researchers, which may come from different institutions, scanners, and populations. Different evaluation measures may be used, making it difficult to compare the methods. In this paper, we introduce a dataset of 7909 breast cancer histopathology images acquired on 82 patients, which is now publicly available from http://web.inf.ufpr.br/vri/breast-cancer-database. The dataset includes both benign and malignant images. The task associated with this dataset is the automated classification of these images in two classes, which would be a valuable computer-aided diagnosis tool for the clinician. In order to assess the difficulty of this task, we show some preliminary results obtained with state-of-the-art image classification systems. The accuracy ranges from 80% to 85%, showing room for improvement is left. By providing this dataset and a standardized evaluation protocol to the scientific community, we hope to gather researchers in both the medical and the machine learning field to advance toward this clinical application.<br>",2016.0,Federal University,"Federal University of Parana (UFPR), Rua Cel.

These studies usually compare the genetic variation between two groups to single out certain Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) that are linked to a phenotypic variation in one of the groups. However, it is necessary to have a large enough sample size to find statistically significant correlations. Direct-To-Consumer (DTC) genetic testing can supply additional data: DTC-companies offer the analysis of a large amount of SNPs for an individual at low cost without the need to consult a physician or geneticist. Over 100,000 people have already been genotyped through Direct-To-Consumer genetic testing companies. However, this data is not public for a variety of reasons and thus cannot be used in research. It seems reasonable to create a central open data repository for such data.
