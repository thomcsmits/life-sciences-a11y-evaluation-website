# Life Sciences Accessibility Evaluation Website

> This website is still a work in progress.

This website showcases the [Life Sciences Accessibility Evaluation](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/life-sciences-a11y-evaluation).

## Development

```sh
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

# Data availability
The data resides in [this repository](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/life-sciences-a11y-evaluation/tree/main/data). It is not yet linked, so the data products are copied over. The zip folders (necessary for bulk downloads) are created with a script that can be run with:

```sh
bash create_zips.sh
```
